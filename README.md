## Install
### PyPi

`pip install scanpro`

### From source: 
- clone the repository
```
git clone https://gitlab.gwdg.de/loosolab/software/scanpro.git
```
- navigate to scanpro directory
```
cd scanpro
```
- then run 
```
pip install .
```
## Quick start
To run the tool import and call the function `scanpro`:
```
from scanpro import scanpro

out = scanpro(adata, clusters_col='clusters', conds_col='condition', samples_col='sample')

```

- If samples_col is not given or set to None, the dataset is assumed to be not replicated and scanpro will run the bootstrapping method.

To show the results, run
```out.results```. 

You can plot the results by calling ```out.plot()```.
